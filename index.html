        <h2> The Tiger and the Woodpecker</h2>
        <p><small></small></p>
        <p>Once upon a time, in a dense forest, there lived a fierce tiger. One day, while hunting, the tiger caught a prey and began to eat. As he was enjoying his meal, a small bone got stuck in his throat. The tiger tried everything to remove the bone, but nothing worked. Days passed, and the tiger grew weaker and weaker, unable to eat or drink.</p>
        <p>Just when the tiger thought he would die, a small woodpecker flew by and saw the tiger in distress. The woodpecker asked, “What happened, mighty tiger?”</p>

        <p>The tiger replied, “A bone is stuck in my throat, and I can’t remove it. I am starving and very weak.”</p>
        <p>The woodpecker offered to help, saying, “I can remove the bone, but you must promise to share your food with 
        Desperate, the tiger agreed.</p>
        <p>The woodpecker flew into the tiger’s mouth and carefully removed the bone. The tiger sighed in relief and thanked the woodpecker.</p>
        <p>The next day, the tiger hunted again, and the woodpecker came to claim his share. However, the tiger, feeling strong and proud, refused to share his food. “I am the king of the forest. Why should I share my food with a tiny bird like you?” he roared.</p><br>
        <h4>The tiger learned a valuable lesson that day: every action has consequences. He realized the importance of keeping promises and treating others with kindness.</h4>
